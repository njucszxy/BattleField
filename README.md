### Process Route

1. Program start from function **Main** in ***BattleField.java***, and initialize a instance of class **BattleField**, then class **BattleField** initialize two sides' creatures in its construction function. After that all creatures have its initial position in battlefield.
2. Then program goes to funciton **Formation** and function **PutLeaders**, Therefore two sides' creatures are ready to battle.
3. Program goes to function **MoveOutside** and move monsters out of battlefield, and goes to funtion **Formation** and function **PutLeaders** as well as function **GetRandomFormation** again in order to get a new formation for monsters.
4. During the two formation, Program output the status of battlefield.

### Designer's Idea

+ All creature class extends from class **Living**.
+ Class **BattleField** works as a constructor, who orders all creatures to move and formate.
+ When some creature is ordered to move to somewhere, it tells its mount to go to the destination.
+ Once someone went to battlefield, it is sociated with one piece of land in battlefield, this piece of land records the creature's name and won't let others use it unless its owner moves to somewhere else.
